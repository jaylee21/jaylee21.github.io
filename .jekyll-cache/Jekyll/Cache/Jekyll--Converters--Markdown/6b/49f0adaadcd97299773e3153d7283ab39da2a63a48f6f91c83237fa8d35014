I"O<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this class project, our group <strong>aimed to develop a classification model</strong> that correctly classifies each posting in the video gaming category in Craigslist into a corresponding brand to enhance user experience and the company’s key business performance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tools / Libraries used:</strong> Python (beautiful soup, pandas, nltk, scikit-learn, keras, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> Web Scrapped / titles and reviews of posts in Craiglist / 3011 rows * 8 columns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Analyses Performed:</strong> Web Scrapping, Data Cleaning/Manipulation, Keyword Extraction, Text Representation(Tokenization, Lemmatization, Vectorization), Machine Learning(Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, Neural Network), Deep Learning(Recurrent Neural Network), Validation(Confusion Matrix), and Business Insights</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Our best model was gradient boosting, performed 81% accuracy in the test dataset. It was greater than the website’s search rate which was 68%.</li>
  <li>It shows that our best model would provide more correct results and minimize information loss on the searches that users performed on the website.</li>
  <li>Therfore, we would expect that our model would contribute to an increase engagement of users with the webiste, leading to growth in retention rate and potentially generating more revenue.</li>
</ul>
